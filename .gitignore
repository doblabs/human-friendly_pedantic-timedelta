# Sphinx docs/ (from `make docs`):
docs/_build/
# `make docs` generates 2 files for the API reference, but one is just
# an index file (modules.rst), which we don't use; and the other is
# the auto-generated API reference. But we override the latter, as
# pedantic-timedelta.rst, so we can add additional directive options.
